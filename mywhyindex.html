        <p style="color: blue;">There were a few reasons that made me to want to study software engineering. The first was my fascination with computers over many years in business and implementing numerous software programs and wishing that I had more skills to adapt them.
           Secondly is the passion and desire to create programs specifically for health and fitness industry specialising around the recreation and outdoor sports such as hiking, ultra trail running and other related sports. This
           desire is derived from my experiences using programs that lack functionality and user safety features specific to the Australian landscape. This has frustrated me enormously and resulted in being lost in numerous national parks unsure which direction to take.
           My third reason was around the variety of different fields or areas that are present. I thrive on working on different projects that keep me motivated and able to continuously learn. 
           Software programming has come so far but I feel it has so much more to offer and evolve. Creating and designing and problem solving are key presonal elements that I feel that a career in software engineering will provide me.
           My last reason has come from realising the way in which humans interact, pay for goods and manage their money is moving to a digital method.. crypto. In recent months I have gained a sound knowledge and learned how digital currency is the next foundation for storging,
           transferring and buying for goods and services around the world. Even though crypocurrency was created over 10 years ago it is slowly gaining preference, and I beleive the next 5 years it will explode creating a huge demand.
